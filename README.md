## Documentation and description of the project
in wiki.pdf or wiki.docx. They refer to the project in the folder pic16f_IR_remote_control_interrupts_NVRAM.X.
This project uses interrupts and 23LCV1024 NVRAMs.

Projects in the other folders are the same one but with no NVRAM usage or with no interrupt usage:
data are stored in a small vector in the microcontroller RAM
